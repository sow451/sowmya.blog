I work in payments. I started my professional career as a lawyer at a Magic Circle Law Firm in London, moved to working in public policy for the Government of India, and fell into the startup world. 

I founded a startup that got into YC, raised funds, built a 14 member team, and then sold it (Fintech -> ACH payments in the USA for high-risk merchants). I now work at my acquirer company (SaaS -> POS software for high-risk merchants) as their Director of Payments.

I'm a parent to 2 young boys, and one dog. I love payment flows, fintech, talking about boring and niche software and writing tiny pieces of code. 🌐💰

I'm an optimist. I'm easygoing and easily amused. Appreciate kindness, good coffee, long walks and streetfood. I like weird/science fiction. In my free time I like to embroider, paint watercolors, and solve a puzzle or two.
