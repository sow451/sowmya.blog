I like starting things, and I'm working on finishing some of what I started. 

Iâ€™m a software product leader with expertise in complex and highly regulated industries. I've worked with regulation all my life: 

- I've implemented regulation as a lawyer with one of the world's best and biggest law firms (Clifford Chance) 

- I've drafted regulation as part of a Finance Ministry Committee led by retired Supreme Court judge (The SriKrishna FSLRC Commission). My work (ie  the regulations I drafted) were approved into law and these regulations are in force today in India, governing systemic risk regulation in the economy. 

- I've read regulation and worked on ... well, working with it, and still ensuring business growth. I did this as a product counsel at Google (Android and an early bit of GPay), and then later as a business and operations lead at Uber (pricing regulations in 5 states in India, each with its own regulatory regime). 

Once I transitioned to a product and business role, my time at Uber inspired me to start my own company: I built a financial products marketplace for gig workers - GIGI Inc in 2019.

Funded by venture and accelerators (Y Combinator W20), my team and I built and distributed regulated products (mutual funds, bank accounts, credit and insurance). Each such product required us to understand and set up funds flow, withdrawal timelines and guidelines and operate under strict scrutiny of atleast 2 regulators. I even wrote an exam to get a mutual fund distributor's licence (and probably know a bit more about them than most regular investors in India)!

GIGI had to pivot due to Covid's impact on gig worker earnings (2020), and my team downsized, scrambled and ultimately ended up building in a niche regulatory space in the US - fintech for high-risk merchants who did legal business, mainly in cannabis. This company, Swifter (rebranded from GIGI), was a which provided tailored payment solutions for high-risk industries. 

Swifter was acquired in a cash and stock transaction in 2022, and I worked at my acquirer, Treez leading their product and growth (i.e. P&L ownership) of their secondary line of revenue - from offering fintech to their SaaS customers. As the Director of Payments at Treez Inc., I led the commercial expansion of ACH payments, optimizing e-commerce conversions and customer satisfaction in the high-risk payments space. 

I now consult for busineses in industries that have to be mindful of regulation from Day 1. And I'm working on a few ideas for my next business opportunity. 

I live in Bangalore, India with my family and I am most active on Twitter - so please find me there.  When I'm not working, I build tiny javascript games for my 6 year old, try to teach my dog some tricks, and read fiction.
