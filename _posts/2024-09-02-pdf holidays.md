excerpt: The 30 mins I had earmarked for this usefully doing things this morning, did not pan out as expected.

I decided to use Chat GPT to extract somed data today. 

Specifically, I wanted to upload the pdfs of the school academic calendar (each child has its own calendar), and then create ical files, that I could add to my calendar apps. 

This did not work well, and the 30 mins I had earmarked for this task, has led to nothing. 

In the meantime, I did make 2 payments, and set up 2 appointments. 

I like to call this the internal 30 min bucket, i.e. what is the volume of disjointed task work I can undertake in 30 mins. 

Today was: 

1. Try to achieve a time-saving thing using technology, and only  get to 10% of desired results (learning that the required library for creating .ics files isn't available in Chat GPT's environment (?) and the best way ahead is to get a pdf- csv file that you I can convert to a .ics file).
2. Make 2 payments to vendors
3. Set up this repo and link the right files so I can start blogging. 
4. Make 2 meeting appointments. 
5. I'll admit I got discracted and read 2 articles about Tokyo Medical University and their practice re limiting the number of female doctors -this took 3 minutes, and in hindsight, was 3 mins wasted. I could have spent a minute reading one article (instead of 2) and started on an easy Sudoku instead. 


That's today's 30 mins.
